Before you begin:
----------------------------------------------------
Some users have reported issues connecting to their server after unpacking and repacking their dayz_server.pbo. 
If this happens to you, follow the installation instructions using PBO Manager further below.


Basic Installation Guide (with PBO Manager):
----------------------------------------------------

**Note**: To avoid pbo corruption, do not use the "Pack into dayz_server.pbo" right-click option. Modify files only using PBO Manager's graphical interface.

1. Unpack your dayz_server.pbo. Right click dayz_server.pbo, select "PBO Manager", click on "Extract to dayz_server\"
2. Inside the unpacked dayz_server folder, locate server_monitor.sqf in dayz_server\system\. Edit server_monitor.sqf with a text editor.
3. Inside server_monitor.sqf, search for the line that says:

		allowConnection = true;

	Change the line to this:

		call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_server\DZAI\init\dzai_initserver.sqf";
		allowConnection = true;
		
4. Right click the DZAI folder inside the download package and click "Copy".
5. Double-click your dayz_server.pbo to open the PBO Manager GUI. Inside the GUI, right-click on "dayz_server.pbo" and click "Paste". In the GUI, you should see "DZAI" in the list below "dayz_server.pbo".
6. Optionally, you may edit DZAI's settings in DZAI\init\dzai_config.sqf
7. Copy all modified files back into their original locations inside dayz_server.pbo using the PBO Manager GUI.


Troubleshooting: A number of users have reported issues with entering the game after repacking their dayz_server.pbo. 
If you encounter this problem, copy the $PBOPREFIX$ file inside the 'extras' folder and paste it inside the dayz_server folder and then repack it into pbo format. This should fix the connection problems.

Note 1: You may store your custom settings changes in DZAI\DZAI_settings_override.sqf. This file is a convenient way to store and transfer your custom settings when upgrading to a newer version of DZAI. Further instructions are provided inside this file.
Note 2: Editing the server_cleanup.fsm is not required for AI vehicle patrols from DZAI version 1.8.0 onwards.
